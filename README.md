Big hugs to open-source for that:

- [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
- [testem](https://github.com/testem/testem)
- [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)
- [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai)
- [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/)

### Developments
Just clone this repo and follow few commands:

```bash
# for developing
npm i && npm run dev
# open http://localhost:8090
```

```bash
# for build system run
npm i && npm run build
# see %YOURAPP%/dist
```

```bash
